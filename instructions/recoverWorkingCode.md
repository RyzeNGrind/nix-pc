Recovering code after data loss, especially when dealing with AI-generated changes, can be tricky. The `COMMIT_EDITMSG` you had for your uncommitted work is the most crucial piece of information, as it describes your _intentions_.

**Your `COMMIT_EDITMSG` for the lost work:**

```
feat: integrate git-hooks.nix and refactor flake structure

Replaced deprecated pre-commit-hooks.nix with git-hooks.nix for managing dev checks. Added flake-parts module to modernize and modularize flake output structure. Cleaned and realigned input versions, especially nixpkgs and WSL-related dependencies. This improves maintainability and future flake extensibility.

New:
- git-hooks.nix for pre-commit integration
- overlays/default.nix for custom pkgs
- instructions/gitHooks.md added for contributor onboarding

Changed:
- Updated flake.lock due to input revisions
- Refactored flake.nix for flake-parts pattern
- Removed unused 'lib' param from configuration.nix
```

It appears your last committed state (`a/` paths in the diff) already incorporated some of these major changes, like the use of `flake-parts` and `git-hooks.nix` in `a/flake.nix`. The recovered uncommitted work (`b/` paths), particularly for `flake.nix` and `flake.lock`, seems to show a regression (e.g., removing `flake-parts`, using older Nixpkgs versions, and using `pre-commit-hooks` instead of `git-hooks.nix`). This regression is likely due to the AI-generated state being incorrect or based on an older snapshot.

**Hereâ€™s a strategy to decide what to recover:**

1.  **Baseline:** Start with your last known good committed state (`a/` paths) for major configuration files like `flake.nix`. The `a/flake.nix` already seems to use `flake-parts` and `git-hooks.nix`.

2.  **Recover New Files' Content:**
    Your `COMMIT_EDITMSG` lists new files. You should recover the _content_ of these files from your `b/` (recovered) directory if they represent your work:

    - **`git-hooks.nix`**: Your `a/flake.nix` likely already points to a `./git-hooks.nix`. Check the content of `b/mnt/c/Users/RyzeNGrind/Workspaces/recovered-Workspaces/nix-pc/git-hooks.nix`. If this is the version you were working on, use its content.
    - **`overlays/default.nix`**: Check the content of `b/mnt/c/Users/RyzeNGrind/Workspaces/recovered-Workspaces/nix-pc/overlays/default.nix`.
    - **`instructions/gitHooks.md`**: Check the content of `b/mnt/c/Users/RyzeNGrind/Workspaces/recovered-Workspaces/nix-pc/instructions/gitHooks.md`.

3.  **Review Changes to Existing Files (Prioritize `a/` versions for major structure):**

    - **`flake.nix`**: The `b/mnt/c/Users/RyzeNGrind/Workspaces/recovered-Workspaces/nix-pc/flake.nix` seems to be a regression. It removes `flake-parts`, changes Nixpkgs from `25.05` to `24.11`, and reintroduces `pre-commit-hooks`. This contradicts your `COMMIT_EDITMSG`. It's safer to stick with `a/flake.nix` (your last committed version) as a base. The "Refactored flake.nix for flake-parts pattern" in your commit message might have referred to smaller tweaks to the existing `flake-parts` structure in `a/flake.nix` rather than a complete overhaul.
    - **`configuration.nix`**:
      - Your commit message says "Removed unused 'lib' param". Your `a/configuration.nix` (committed) has `#lib` (commented out), while `b/.../configuration.nix` (recovered) reintroduces `lib`. Stick to the version in `a/` where `lib` is already handled/removed.
      - The `b/.../configuration.nix` also removes the `home-manager` section and changes `system.stateVersion` from `25.05` to `24.11`. These are likely incorrect regressions from the AI or recovery process. Be very cautious; these changes from `b/` are probably not what you want.
    - **`.git/config`**: The changes in `b/mnt/c/Users/RyzeNGrind/Workspaces/recovered-Workspaces/nix-pc/.git/config` seem beneficial:
      - The remote URL was changed to remove an embedded personal access token. This is a good security practice.
      - `fsmonitor = false`, `untrackedcache = false`, and `hooksPath = .git/hooks` were removed. The removal of `hooksPath` aligns with using `git-hooks.nix` (via `flake-parts`) to manage hooks. These specific changes to your `.git/config` are likely worth keeping.
    - **`.gitignore` & `README.md`**: These have minor changes. Review the versions from `b/` and incorporate any intentional modifications.

4.  **`flake.lock` File:**
    The `b/mnt/c/Users/RyzeNGrind/Workspaces/recovered-Workspaces/nix-pc/flake.lock` reflects the changes in the problematic `b/flake.nix`. Once you have a correct `flake.nix` (likely by starting with `a/flake.nix` and ensuring it correctly references any new/updated files like `git-hooks.nix`), you should regenerate the `flake.lock` file by running `nix flake update` or `nix flake lock --update-input <input-name>` for specific inputs.

**Summary of What to Prioritize from Recovered `b/` Paths:**

- **Content of New Files:** The actual code/text for `git-hooks.nix`, `overlays/default.nix`, and `instructions/gitHooks.md`.
- **Specific `.git/config` Changes:** Remote URL update and removal of local Git settings like `hooksPath`.
- **Recognizable, Intentional Small Changes:** Any other specific code snippets or modifications in `b/` files that you recognize as your deliberate work and which align with your `COMMIT_EDITMSG`, but are not the large structural regressions seen in `b/flake.nix`.

**Caution:** The AI-generated state in `b/` for `flake.nix` and `flake.lock` appears to be a significant step backward and contradicts your stated intentions in `COMMIT_EDITMSG`. It's generally advisable to discard these parts of the recovered work (`b/flake.nix`, `b/flake.lock`) and rely on your last committed versions (`a/`) as a more stable foundation, then manually integrate the specific, valuable pieces of your uncommitted work.
